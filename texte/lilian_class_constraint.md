#  Lilian -- The Competitive Constraint

## Part I

### Chapter 1: Putting Disparities into Perspective
Is the conception on non-ideal theory consistent, does it also apply to f.e.
Mill (who is sited), how does Lillian relate to non-ideal herself?

RC: Form of inclusion, which also *transforms*? Meaning: 

### Chapter 2: Rethinking What’s Wrong with “The Economy”
Re-conceptualize/ What is the economy? (practice theoretic arguments) 

What is the problem with the economy?

Plot KT: 
1.~Nancy (later) and Honneth (young) might have opened the black box, in
contrast of f.e.~Habermas 
2.~Neurath VS Weber plot

"Capacity with an *interest* in exercising arbitrary power."

Considering Adornos ND, his critique of instrumental reason, *as a result of*
Markets and the value form, would actually persist to criticise *markets* (and
value form) as the broader and more important *basis of* competition etc.

### Chapter 4: 
If the idea is self-emancipation of the proletariat, but self emancipation
means, emancipation from corruption through constrains, how to make sens 
*of* emancipation, if the proletariat *is* corrupt ans constrained?  
-> being constrained, does not imply being constrained to perform emancipation.

Corruption as a replacement of false consciousness? 

## Part II

### Chapter 5: Contours of Class Conflict
1.~Capitalism necessarily (re-)produces social differentiation. And they are bound
to essentialist subscriptions. This undermines the claim to not be
reductionist: 
Capitalism necessarily produces racism and sexism, only the *appearances* must
be explained by factors external to the economy.
Lillian: I'm sure there are more factors, I'm unsure about people seeing the
range, to which the economy can explain factors (1.~production of social
differentiation, 2.~differentiation linked to essentialist factors, p.~191ff)

Solidarity appears to be *outside* of the economy, outside of capitalism. But how
does it relate to:
Solidarity = Rights of the seller against rights of the buyer of labor power (Marx).

### Chapter 6: Is Capitalism Systemically Racist?
Internalism VS externalism account of race/ racism:  
Maybe a practice orientated account goes "through" the distinction of the two?

What is anything is wrong with functionalism? 

Capitalism forces the rationalisation of inequality in a new way! (this
rationalisation then connects to essentialist [...] means (c.l.~232).


### Chapter 7: Where Are the Independent Women?
The welfare-state has the capacity to exercise arbitrary power, although it does not 
have to.

Woman's strike in Spain, (linking up with the labor movement), also refusing to
go to work. -> Focus -- for Lillian -- is not necessarily the connection with the
labor *movement* but linking reproduction strikes with capital in a way like
refusing to go to work.

### Conclusion: 
What does it mean to talk of Solidarity as a fact? 
- broad anchoring in society
- Pseudo-solidarity?
