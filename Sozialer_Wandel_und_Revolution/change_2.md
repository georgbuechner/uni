# Workshop: Change². The Disruptions of Social Structures

## Panel I: Structure, System, Organism, and Social Functions 
*– Social theories of dynamic orders and radical change*

### Organisms, Systems, functions 
*-- Concepts of transformation in social theories of dynamism*

Reform ↔ Revolutions  
→ instead: meaningful change

f.e. R.J. "Fortshritt" does not prohibi *radical* change in any way.
f.e. Faschists used the term/ wanted *radical transformation*, thus: not all
radical transformation is per se *good*.

What kind of entity is society if it is ... to falling ill?

Durkheim sozial transformation: 
- social divisions of labour
- societies 

segmentaly structures societies VS organically structured societies
→ radical transformation

Due to growth of population and density, the need of specialisation, e.i.
divisions of labour, comes up, since the needs of all members of society can not
be satisfied witout a development of society.

Karen Ng. "Morality is backward looking" and thus does not belong to social
change?

1. Articulating the good is essential for the social (critical) theorists 
2. Analogies and dis-analogies societies and Organisms
3. ???

**Good**: "Living good" is *always present* (in habits, institutions, etc.)
epical (???)

Crisis ↔ Critical (also: medical term)

Crisis VS catastrophe
- reversible | irreversible
- managemental solution |
⇒ we live in catastrophic times

RH: Die Krise bestimmt die Frage nach Reform/ Revolution\
RH: why not say that the good *is* realized (instead of speaking of "*partial*"
realization)? Also with Marx one could say that capitalism produces wealth but
in an inverted form (for the rich), it produces cooperation but in a inverted
form (through market mechanisms), it produces freedom (but only for those with
the material resources)
