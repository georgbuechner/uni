#### Can't we also read Adorno as a philosopher who *points out* the importance of "discursiv breakdown"
While it's true that he writes f.e. 
"Ästhetische Erfahrung muss Philosophie werden, oder sie ist überhaupt nicht" 
one must take into account that philosophy is the struggle talking about that
which is outside of our discursive field. 
The (ästhetic) expierience (which Adorno explicitly labels a neccesery
precondition for his kind of philosophy) would then as a discursive breakdown
point to a gap, which (dialetical) philosophy tries to grasp with concepts. I
say "grasp" not "fill".

#### Moral articulation, discursive breakdown, seems to have a function as breaking through ideology (vgl. S. 42)
In the examples it is not Antonio who feels the described dissonance, nor is it
cleary described by Murdoch how the mother suddenly feels a unease that causes
her to rethink. 
Rather -- in the case of *Bycicle Thefes* -- it's the film (the artwork) that
makes us feel this dissonance, the undefined sense of unfairness, that might
the, through articulation transform into the described thesis: that to poor must
steel and so on. 
You mention, how ideology (of a false world) might f.e. influence our judgement,
providing an additional argument agains a ideal theory (?? page ??). 
However on the other side this feeling of dissonance seems such a strong moment
of breaking down the illusion of ideology, or what you want to name it.
There are two questions here:
1. Could you elaborate more on the connection of discursive breakdown, this
   feeling of dissonance and potentially ideology critique (not in the "strong"
   sense)
2. How does this feeling *emerge*. Atleast chap1 seems to be focused more and
   the articulation of the feeling that is already there. 

#### How do you avoid a post-structuralist "anything goes"?
I was reminded of Nietzsches "Es genügt neue Namen zu geben, um auf die Länge
hin neue Dinge zu schaffen" (fröhliche Wissenschaft irgendwo). 
From this it's easy to assume a post-structuralist anything goes. As you point
out on page 48 with Taylor (yardstick = deepest unstructured sense...) the
material boundary is ones own expierience, is that correct? Would you describe
that as a materialist moment?

#### Is expierience also mediated by society? 
Is is quite clear that (moral) articulation is fundamentally social, but what
about the expierience?
(When Adorno states: that the expierience is not so much only my own, does that
stand in contradiction to you theory, does is presupose a discursive notion to
the expierience which you would reject?)
