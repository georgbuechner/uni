## Zusammenfassung 

### Einleitung 1-2 Sätze: 
Ziel: Dasjenige näher zu bestimmen, was *vor* dem Judgment aufkommt, nämlich das
Zusatndekommen moralischer Überzeugungen durch moral articulation of discursiv
breakdown. 
Kurz sagen, welche Aspekte er damit noch lösen/ angehen will (moralischer
Fortschritt etc.) 

What is an experience? 
- preformed 
- influenced by me
- not discursiv/ propositional (ideal agent?)

What is discursiv breakdown? 
What is an illusion-based discursiv breakdown? (p.26)

What is moral articulation?


#### Can't we also read Adorno as a philosopher who *points out* the importance of "discursiv breakdown"?
While it's true that he writes f.e. 
"Ästhetische Erfahrung muss Philosophie werden, oder sie ist überhaupt nicht"
(ÄT, S. 197)
one must take into account that philosophy is the struggle talking about that
which is outside of our discursive field. 
The (aesthetic) experience (which Adorno explicitly labels a necessary 
precondition for his kind of philosophy (f.e. ÄT 100) would then -- as a discursive 
breakdown -- point to a gap, which (dialetical) philosophy tries to grasp with 
concepts. 
I say "grasp" not "fill".

#### Why should expieriences be valuable in itself? (cl. p.36)


#### Moral articulation, discursive breakdown, seems to have a function as breaking through ideology (vgl. S. 42)
In the examples it is not Antonio who feels the described dissonance, nor is it
clearly described by Murdoch how the mother suddenly feels an unease that causes
her to rethink. 
Rather -- in the case of *Bicycle Thieves* -- it's the film (the artwork) that
makes us feel this dissonance, the undefined sense of unfairness, that might
then -- through articulation -- transform into the described thesis: that 
the poor are forced to steel...
You mention how ideology (of a false world) might f.e.~influence our judgement,
providing an additional argument against a ideal theory (?? page ??). 
However, on the other side this feeling of dissonance seems such a strong moment
of breaking down the illusion of ideology (as the Bicycle Thieves shows us)
There are two questions here:
1. How does this feeling *emerge*. Atleast chap1 seems to be focused more and
   the articulation of the feeling that is already there. 
2. Could you elaborate more on the connection of discursive breakdown, this
   feeling of dissonance and potentially ideology critique (not in the "strong"
   sense)
If discursive breakdown has such a string case in breaking down ideology, how
can we conceptionalize the emergence of this breakdown.

#### How do you avoid a post-structuralist "anything goes"?
I was reminded of Nietzsches "Es genügt neue Namen zu geben, um auf die Länge
hin neue Dinge zu schaffen" (fröhliche Wissenschaft irgendwo). 
From here it's easy to assume a post-structuralist "anything goes". As you point
out on page 48 with Taylor (yardstick = deepest unstructured sense...) the
material boundary is ones own expierience, is that correct? Would you describe
that as a **materialist moment** and how is it connected to a **bodly expierience**
(Leib)?
Here again, Adorno points out that expierience is 
- a) mediated by the subject making the expierience (durch den *Erfahrenden*) and 
- b) by the thing that is expierienced (durch das *Erfahrene*): "Ohne ein Etwas, 
    auf das sie sich bezieht, ohne ein Substrat, gäbe es eine Erfahrung
    überhaupt nicht." (philosophische Terminologie, p.85)

Is misarticulation (p. 50) also connected to this materialist moment?

#### Is expierience also mediated by society? 
You state clearly that (moral) articulation is fundamentally social, but what
about the expierience?
Adorno state (philosophische Terminologie p.82): 
"[...] daß solche Dinge, die ein reflektierter Mensch an sich selbst erfahren
hat im allgemeinen gar nicht so sehr auf ihn beschränkt sind [...]"

If experience is mediated by society how can we grasp this mediation? Would that
imply a propositional content? Or is the mediation connected to the materialist
moment.

#### Can the *articulation* of an expierience negate the expierience? 
I'm thinking of Benjamins Idea, on execution of the death penealty may be moral,
never it's legitimation (c.l. ND, S. 282)
Das discursive Festhalten der Erfahrung negiert die Erfahrung?
