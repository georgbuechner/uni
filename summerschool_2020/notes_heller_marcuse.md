## Marcuse
Reasonable comfortable unfreedom, exploitation is no longer as obvious. Thus the
problem of liberation shifts: 

Marcuse holistic (up to people to define needs) 
-> lack of critical potential 
BUT: Only when they are free!


Critical praxis? Change of emphasize: liberation instead of freedom.

New immediacy through media and technology. (This seems to be something like a
tendency in technology).

George: 
- one-dimensional subject *through* technology
- And overcoming one-dimensional subject *by* technology
-> where is the political (need based) approach? 

Critique of technology, including a potential.
Co-development of human being and technology. 
a) Tension: Marxian perspective on technology technology is historic and
anti-essential (put to the right ends). 
b) BUT technology itself must change, as it was geared towards the struggle 
of existence (and maintenance of domination), thus must technology change, can
it change? None of the less it here has 
-> reversing the Heiddegerian notion: it *has* essence, thus it must and can be
changed.

Parallel between not assuming to much continuity in needs (A&H), and technology
(Marcuse)

Translation of values in technology?

We will be free and we will be different (technology is neither good, nor bad,
we have to change it)

Relational between subject and technology. When you change the technology, you
change the subject
Technology not only determined by bad rationality 

Universal standards: satisfaction of vital needs 

Technology not given, in use also 

New needs that can not easily be corrupted? 

## Heller
How does capitalism create just these needs, the "radical needs"? 
Radical needs is *necessarily created* by capitalism.

Suffering as necessary drive? 
b) There is suffering, and we need to talk it to a breaking point.

How do radical needs come up?
a) total alienation and conciousness of alienation -> radical needs
b) capitalism produces worker community -> need for community
c) needs of the rich -> need to realize  (???)

Radical needs <-> interest:
f.e. trade-unions: 
- interest: higher wages
- radical need: abolition of the wage system

Similarities between both: 
- possibility and impossibility 
- generation of free time

## Questions

### (1) Question on Marcuse
Technology between a) non-essential in the sense that it is not technology as
such, but it can also be a drive for change, an emancipatory potential and b)
essential in the sense that not *the same* technology can be used. Capitalism
incororates an essense into technology.
#### Questions: 
- What does in this context the necessary change of technology mean, or refere
  to? Do we have to draw a distinction between "projects" (gun) and the
  technology of gun-powder?
- How is technology able to function as a "motor" for social change
if it is at the same time subject-constitutive under capitalism ((up to the
subjects core):
- one-dimensional subject *through* technology
- And overcoming one-dimensional subject *by* technology
-> where is the political (need based) approach? 


### (2) Question on Heller
Statring with the discussion of the necessity of suffering, for generation of
radical needs, we advance to more specific notions, turning away from pure focus
on suffering (which would entail the problematic perspective of enhancing
suffering to produce radical needs -- Lenin)
Heller is nore precice, capitalism generates a) alienation, but also b)
conciousness of alienation and thus a radical need. 
Also capitalism produces (large) worker communities, and thus the (radical) need
for community.
#### Questions
- How does Heller's account of radical needs relate to Marcuse?

Question 3: 
class passee and one cant ?
